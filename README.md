# Lab 3
For this lab, you are required to use your free AWS account to experiment with a basic Makefile and extend it. Follow the instructions below:
- Review the example GitHub Project, GitHub Actions pytest and then experiment with a basic Makefile and extend it. Makefile is an important concept to master because it is a way of running complex commands in a repeatable and simple manner. [MO 3.4]
- Watch and review this video tutorial: Construct a Python Project Scaffold. This video demonstrates an important concept in cloud computing: building repeatable development environments that allow for continuous integration and continuous development.
- Construct a scaffold using the video as an example.
- Screenshot your project result and submit it with the link to your file to the Lab Assignment submission link in Moodle. You should also include a short reflection (under 200 words) of what you have learned from the lab and any challenges and problems you faced in your submission. [MO 3.2]
